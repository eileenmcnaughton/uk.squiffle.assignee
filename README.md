# Activity Assignee Settings #

### What is this extension for? ###

This module provides two functions affecting Activity Assignees:

#### 1 Limit Assignees to a specified group

Normally an activity can be assigned to any contact.  By default, this sends a mail to the assignee which can be very useful, but if the wrong individual is selected, information about the activity is sent to the wrong person which could disclose confidential information.

This extension limits the assignees of any activity to a specified group (static or smart) such as staff.

#### 2 Default assignee is current user

Normally the assignee field is blank when adding an Activity.  If the main use of activities is to record people's own actions then always needing to add oneself as the assignee is repetitive.

This option allows the current user to be as the default assignees.  

### How do I get set up? ###

Install the extension as normal.  A menu item should be created at Administer >> System Settings >> Activity Assignee Settings

On that page, simply select the group of contacts that may be assigned activities and choose whether the current user is the default assignee. 

### Limitations ###

The same group is used to limit all activity types.
